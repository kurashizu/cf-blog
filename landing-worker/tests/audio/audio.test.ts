/**
 * What a patch sounds like, measured.
 *
 * Everything in tests/unit builds patches against a recording context and
 * asserts on what got connected. That finds a cable landing on the wrong param.
 * It cannot find a patch that sounds wrong, because a fake context produces no
 * samples -- so "the knob reads zero" was asserted over and over while "the
 * sound stops" never was, and those are not the same claim.
 *
 * The tremolo patch is what proved the gap. Its unit tests passed at every
 * stage, including the stage where MAP silently dropped the waveform on its
 * input and put out a flat level: every one of MAP's settings still visibly
 * changed that level, so from the inside it looked like it was working.
 *
 * This drives a real Chrome against a real OfflineAudioContext through
 * /synth/audit, and reports the amplitude envelope of one held note. An
 * assertion here is about the sound.
 *
 * Two controls run first and are not decoration. A graph with nothing wired to
 * OUT has to measure exactly zero, or the bench is picking up something other
 * than the patch -- which it was, twice, before those controls were added.
