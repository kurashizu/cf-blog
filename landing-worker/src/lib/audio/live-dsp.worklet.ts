/**
 * The synth's AudioWorklet processors: the modules whose settings a native
 * Web Audio node can only take once, when the note starts.
 *
 * An envelope built from `linearRampToValueAtTime` has its attack time baked
 * into the schedule the moment it is written, so a cable into ATTACK could
 * only ever be read as a number at note-on -- and a moving signal there was
 * read as nothing at all. Here every parameter is an a-rate AudioParam the
 * processor reads per sample, so a cable moves it while the note plays.
 *
 * Runs on the audio thread, bundled on its own by Vite (`?worker&url`), so it
 * imports nothing but the shared parameter list.
